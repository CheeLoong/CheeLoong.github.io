It's been a while, 4 years exactly since I last updated my own blogpost (life was busy, ahem, still busy!). You see, I started this whole blogpost thing as a way to beam my capabilities to potential employers which doesn't align with what I truly have in mind, to show case my interest and maybe update on whether I am still alive. (so, I've scrubbed the previous posts that didn't align with that vision). Glad to have met some amazing people who gave me a shot and opportunities to learn and grow in the analytics space, and most importantly as a person. 

So, to everyone whom I have met in the past 4 years, I am pretty sure there were time where I wasn't my best, maybe I seem a little unfriendly, or a little arrogant, or didn't care enough, maybe we don't even talk anymore, but it's okay,  because I still recall and cherish our interactions with gratitude (even those who were on a less harmonious wavelength).

Personal growth algorithms have undergone numerous updates. I've debugged most of my ego, optimized my patience, and fine-tuned my self-awareness. I feel like I am a lot happier now (not that I was depressed before), and I am not sure why exactly, maybe its because even if the roadmap is dynamic, the trajectory seems promising?

Anyway, I've spent some unhealthy amount of time interacting with ChatGPT and consuming media related to it, and I find it so fascinating that I want to invest more time in it, and I would also like to document my learning and finding because I believe this tech is set to reprogram our way of life, our cognitive functions, and potentially our survival codes - It's unclear how this new chapter of human-machine integration will unfold, but one thing's clear -- I am fkin in!
