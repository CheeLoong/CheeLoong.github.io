It's been a while, 4 years exactly since I last updated my own blogpost (life was busy, ahem, still busy!), let's be real here, I did this to impress my potential employers back then (since it's not really meaningful to me, I just unpublished most of them), it didn't help much because I was terrible at interviews, glad to have met some amazing people who gave me a shot and opportunities to learn and grow in the analytics space, and most importantly as a person. 

So, to everyone whom I have met in the past 4 years, I am pretty sure there were time where I wasn't my best, maybe I seem a little unfriendly, or a little arrogant, or didn't care enough, maybe we don't even talk anymore, but it's okay, because I do remember every single one of you and am grateful to have met every single one of you (yes, even if you were being a total jerk in the past)

I've learnt to be a lot more self-aware, I have learnt to be a lot more patient, I have learnt to let go a huge chunkas of my ego, I would also do my best to remind myself to hold myself accountable whenever I break, I feel like I am a lot happier now (not that I was depressed before), and I am not sure why exactly, could be because I feel like I am headed towards the right direction even though I have no clue where I am headed (idk if that makes sense lol). 

Anyway, I've spent some unhealthy amount of time interacting with ChatGPT and consuming media related to it, and I find it so fascinated that I want to invest more time in it, and I would also like to document my learning and finding because I believe one day it would change the way we live, the way we think, and the way we..survive? At this point, it's hard to say how exactly it would change us, but I want to make sure I am committed to this, which is why...I am back.
