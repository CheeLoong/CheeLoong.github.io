Intro: Welcome to the second episode of my ChatGPT series. Today, we're diving deep into the enchanting world of coding with GPT-4. Think automation, Python, a sprinkle of humor, and a lesson or two about life. Ready? Let's jump in.

## Once Upon a Code...
A few years back, I hopped on the Python train, and honestly, while the buzz around coding was fun, fixing broken codes? Not so much.
The process of building is often magical, but the price to pay is too high with my monkey brain.

## The Big Project: Risk Rules and Why I Won't Do It Manually
Ok, let's actually talk about the automation project. 
The objective is to create risk rules in our internal risk rule system (for those who don't know what this is, you know how you can't casually throw around a million bucks in transactions, that's risk rule system in action!). Anyway, the risk rule system is...s.. *prompting CHATGPT* Ahh yes, The product lacks the finesse and refinement one might expect.

Now, get this: out of 51 rules, I manually punched in three. Simple math? Thatâ€™s 3.5 hours if I kept going at that pace. And not to self-shame, but in those three attempts, two had errors. 

Here's where the BIG BRAIN move came in: instead of staring at screens for hours and risking mistakes, why not just create a python script with GPT4 to automate the process I am sure it will not take longer than an hour to create it? Spoiler: It took 15 hours. BUT picture this: future me, breezing through manual tasks like this. Worth it? Heck yes.


## How's It Done, You Ask? Enter GPT4
It's pretty straightforward.

and eventually you get this:

==COULD NOT INSERT THE VIDEO RECORDING OF AWESOME AUTOMATION BECAUSE ITS COMPANY PROPERTY==

```python
import os
import logging
import time
from utility import ChromeSetup, RiskRuleControls, setup_logging, deploy_risk_rule
from rule_config import RISK_RULE_CONFIG


####### CONSTANTS #######
PROFILE_PATH = "/Users/cllian/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 2"
URL = 'https://sample.com/'

####### Environment Setup #######
# 1. Set up logging
setup_logging()
logging.info(f"Current working directory: {os.getcwd()}")

# 2. Setup Chrome
chrome_setup = ChromeSetup(PROFILE_PATH)
chrome_setup.prepare_driver()
chrome_setup.start_chrome_browser()
chrome_setup.navigate_to_website(URL)
driver = chrome_setup.get_driver()

# 3. Setup config
SG_RISK_RULE_COMBINATIONS = [
    {'txn_country': '', 'ip_country': '', 'operator_value': ''},
    {'txn_country': '', 'ip_country': '', 'operator_value': ''},
    {'txn_country': '', 'ip_country': '', 'operator_value': ''},
]

# 4. Instantiate the RiskRuleControls class to automate rule creation
controls = RiskRuleControls(driver)

for config in SG_RISK_RULE_COMBINATIONS:
    # Navigate to the rule creation page before processing each rule
    chrome_setup.navigate_to_website(URL)

    # Wait for 3 seconds for page to load 
    time.sleep(3)

    updated_config = RISK_RULE_CONFIG.copy()
    updated_config['txn_country'] = config['txn_country']  # Update the txn_country
    updated_config['ip_country'] = config['ip_country']  # Update the ip_country
    updated_config['operator_value'] = config['operator_value']  # Update the operator_value

    # Deploy the rule using the updated config
    deploy_risk_rule(controls, updated_config)

    # Wait for 5 seconds before deploying the next rule
    time.sleep(5)

# close the browser after all rules are deployed
driver.quit()

```

Here's some of the prompts I've used:

## Some Risks (Output Misinformation):

-> insert misinformation prompt screenshot

Models like GPT-4 are game-changers, but they aren't flawless. Misinformation can creep in. However, before we get on our high horses, let's remember that even us humans sometimes get our wires crossed. So, let's focus on continuous improvement, both in tech and in ourselves, and cut down on the hypocrisy, shall we?
