Intro: Welcome to the second episode of my ChatGPT series. Today, we're diving deep into the enchanting world of coding with GPT-4. Think automation, Python, a sprinkle of humor, and a lesson or two about life. Ready? Let's jump in.

## The Big Project: Deploying Risk Rules and Why I Won't Do It Manually
Simply put, my manager gave me a task, deploy 51 risk rules manually (for those who don't know what this is, you know how you can't casually throw around a million bucks in transactions, that's risk rule system in action!). Anyway, the risk rule system is...

Now, get this: out of 51 rules, I manually punched in three. Simple math? Thatâ€™s 3.5 hours if I kept going at that pace. And not to self-shame, but in those three attempts, two had errors. 

Here's where the BIG BRAIN move came in: instead of staring at screens for hours and risking mistakes, why not just create a python script with GPT4 to automate the process I am sure it will not take longer than an hour to create it? Spoiler: It took 15 hours. BUT picture this: future me, breezing through manual tasks like this. Worth it? Heck yes.


## How's It Done, You Ask? Enter GPT4
It's pretty straightforward.

and eventually you get this:

/// VIDEO DISABLED AS THIS IS COMPANY PROPERTY BUT - IMAGINE A REALLY COOL VIDEO RECORDING OF RISK RULE AUTOMATION ///

```python
import os
import logging
import time
from utility import ChromeSetup, RiskRuleControls, setup_logging, deploy_risk_rule
from rule_config import RISK_RULE_CONFIG


####### CONSTANTS #######
PROFILE_PATH = "/Users/cllian/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 2"
URL = 'https://sample.com/'

####### Environment Setup #######
# 1. Set up logging
setup_logging()
logging.info(f"Current working directory: {os.getcwd()}")

# 2. Setup Chrome
chrome_setup = ChromeSetup(PROFILE_PATH)
chrome_setup.prepare_driver()
chrome_setup.start_chrome_browser()
chrome_setup.navigate_to_website(URL)
driver = chrome_setup.get_driver()

# 3. Setup config
SG_RISK_RULE_COMBINATIONS = [
    {'txn_country': '', 'ip_country': '', 'operator_value': ''},
    {'txn_country': '', 'ip_country': '', 'operator_value': ''},
    {'txn_country': '', 'ip_country': '', 'operator_value': ''},
]

# 4. Instantiate the RiskRuleControls class to automate rule creation
controls = RiskRuleControls(driver)

for config in SG_RISK_RULE_COMBINATIONS:
    # Navigate to the rule creation page before processing each rule
    chrome_setup.navigate_to_website(URL)

    # Wait for 3 seconds for page to load 
    time.sleep(3)

    updated_config = RISK_RULE_CONFIG.copy()
    updated_config['txn_country'] = config['txn_country']  # Update the txn_country
    updated_config['ip_country'] = config['ip_country']  # Update the ip_country
    updated_config['operator_value'] = config['operator_value']  # Update the operator_value

    # Deploy the rule using the updated config
    deploy_risk_rule(controls, updated_config)

    # Wait for 5 seconds before deploying the next rule
    time.sleep(5)

# close the browser after all rules are deployed
driver.quit()

```

Here's some of the prompts I've used:

## Some Risks (Output Misinformation):

As awesome as GPT-4 is, it is not perfect (just like human), based on the above example, when GPT4 gets into rabbit hole of misinformation, I was not able to get out of it. I had to start a new chat and kind of copy over where I left out to continue the interaction as per normal. 

IMHO, all in all, the productivity gain greatly offset the little misinformation loss from GPT4, and I am pretty sure the gap would get smaller as time goes on, so I am still very much a happy customer on this front. And..well that's about it for now, kthxbai.
