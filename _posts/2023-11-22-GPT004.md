Intro: Recently, there' a real life soap opera in silicon valley featuring the openai gang, found it quite interesting, but would not go deep into it.

Anyway can't control what we can't control, let's talk about custom GPT, these were announced on OpenAI live stream on Nov 7th, 2023 but the access was only made available few days after (I got my access on Nov 10th, 2023 SGT time). 

Why is this great?
If you have tried ChatGPT before, you understand it suffers from quite a few weaknesses, and in order to improve it, we could fine tune the response quality with award winning prompt engineering (i.e. asking the question in an articulative manner) + instil false belief system to make AI imagine they're the real deal (e.g. assume you're a lawyer with 3000 years experience, and you never lost a case, bla bla)

before custom GPT, we have this interface

and on the left we would have a lot of chat history with AI, the painpoint was that everytime you open a new chat on the top left, you start fresh with a new default GPT, and you gotta copy and paste the prompt that you have created previously to fine tune it again. Obviously for different tasks you would have different prompts and so the introduction of custom GPT would mean the end to all these redundant work. 


What?
now, we can create an agent (or as we call it custom GPTs) to work on various task. e.g. I created SundaeWithFries which is a GPT that specialises in giving relationship advices.

Why?
I wanted to test 3 things: 
1. Would AI be able to sound more human-like? (note: I am not trying to spread fake news or promote AI generated content, but the objective is to create a companion-like assistant, so its important that it sounds like human so that users would feel like they aren't talking to a bot!)
2. Are the advices actually sound? (i.e. do ppl think its bs or it genuinely helped them?)
3. Is my own personal self-introspection able to influence others in a good way? (i.e. the value that I instilled in AI, are they being appreciated by other users?)


The result? (>500 karma on reddit in less than a week)
