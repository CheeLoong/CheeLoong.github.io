Intro: Recently, there' a real life soap opera in silicon valley featuring the openai gang, while it's fascinating, let's not delve too deeply into it.

Anyway can't control what we can't control, let's shift our focus to custom GPTs. OpenAI unveiled these during their live stream on November 7th, 2023, but access was only granted a few days later (I got mine on November 10th, 2023, SGT time).

Why is this great?
If you have tried ChatGPT before, you understand it suffers from quite a few weaknesses, and in order to improve it, we could fine tune the response quality with award winning prompt engineering (i.e. asking the question in an articulative manner) + instil false belief system to make AI imagine they're the real deal (e.g. assume you're a lawyer with 3000 years experience, and you never lost a case, bla bla)

Before custom GPT, ChatGPT interface looked like this:

On the left, we had extensive chat history with the AI. The drawback was that starting a new chat meant resetting with a default GPT, necessitating the manual transfer of previous prompts for fine-tuning. With custom GPTs, this redundancy is now a thing of the past.


What's new? We can now create agents, or custom GPTs, tailored for various tasks. For instance, I've created "SundaeWithFries," a GPT specialized in offering relationship advice.

Why?
I wanted to test 2 things: 
1. Can AI sound more human-like? (Note: This isn't about spreading fake news but creating a companion-like assistant that feels human, not robotic.)
2. Are the advice and suggestions genuinely sound? (i.e. Can my own values and insights positively influence others?)


The result? (>500 karma on reddit in less than a week)

I invested about 5 days in this project. While I didn't merely copy and paste, it's a collaborative effort between the GPT and myself, think of this GPT as an extended version of myself (or as closely to myself as possible with the current tech), combining my values with articulate fine-tuning from the GPT. I believe it has genuinely helped a few people, and I haven't been called out as a bot. Occasionally, I receive grateful replies to my comments. I'm delighted to be able to assist these users. I've succeeded in the three objectives mentioned earlier. Now, what's next?
