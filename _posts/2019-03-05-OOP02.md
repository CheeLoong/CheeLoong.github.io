# Instance Method vs Class Methods

We have explored Instance Method in the previous post, and now we are going to talk about Class Methods.

A class method is a method that is bound to a class rather than its object. It doesn't require creation of a class instance.

```python
# Python OOP

class Employee:

    # Class variable
    num_of_emps = 0
    raise_amt = 1.04 # raise_amount is a class variable

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

        Employee.num_of_emps += 1 # Employee.num_of_emps makes much more sense than self.num_of_emps

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)

    # Class Method
    @classmethod
    def set_raise_amt(cls, amount):
        cls.raise_amt = amount

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 50000)
```


```python
print(Employee.raise_amt)
print(emp_1.raise_amt)
print(emp_2.raise_amt)
```

    1.04
    1.04
    1.04



```python
# let's try to use the class method
Employee.set_raise_amt(1.05)

print(Employee.raise_amt)
print(emp_1.raise_amt)
print(emp_2.raise_amt)
```

    1.05
    1.05
    1.05


The above is equivalent to setting `Employee.raise_amount = 1.05`.

We can also use *classmethod* as an alternative constructor. Let's look at an example before we explain how *classmethod* can act as an alternative constructor.

suppose we are given a string for every employee, which consist of employee information separated by hyphen, we would have to do the following before we use the `Employee` Class:


```python
# employee information as string
emp_str_1 = 'John-Cena-10000'
emp_str_2 = 'Lionel-Messi-60000'
emp_str_3 = 'Matt-Murdock-30000'

# extract information from the string
first, last, pay = emp_str_1.split('-')

# instantiate employee
new_emp_1 = Employee(first, last, int(pay))

print(new_emp_1.email)
print(new_emp_1.pay)
```

    John.Cena@unemployed.com
    10000


Let's try to use *classmethod* as alternative constructor:


```python
# Python OOP

class Employee:

    # Class variable
    num_of_emps = 0
    raise_amt = 1.04 # raise_amount is a class variable

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

        Employee.num_of_emps += 1 # Employee.num_of_emps makes much more sense than self.num_of_emps

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)

    # ClassMethod
    @classmethod
    def set_raise_amt(cls, amount):
        cls.raise_amt = amount

    # ClassMethod as alternative constructor
    @classmethod
    def from_string(cls, emp_str):
        first, last, pay = emp_str.split('-')
        return cls(first, last, int(pay))

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 50000)
# employee information as string
emp_str_1 = 'John-Cena-10000'
emp_str_2 = 'Lionel-Messi-60000'
emp_str_3 = 'Matt-Murdock-30000'
```


```python
# let's try to use the alternative constructor
new_emp_3 = Employee.from_string(emp_str_3)

print(new_emp_3.email)
print(new_emp_3.pay)
```

    Matt.Murdock@unemployed.com
    30000


So now we have established that a `normal method/ instance method` pass an instance as their first argument and that a `classmethod` pass a class as their first argument.

Let's talk about `staticmethod`, `staticmethod` does not pass instance nor class as the first argument, they behave like a function but we include them in classes because they have some logical connection to the class.

suppose we want to write a simple function that would take in a date as argument and return whether or not it is a work day, which has a logical connection to the `Employee` class, but it does not actually depend on any specific instance or class variable. This is an example of a `staticmethod`.


```python
# Python OOP

class Employee:

    # Class variable
    num_of_emps = 0
    raise_amt = 1.04 # raise_amount is a class variable

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

        Employee.num_of_emps += 1 # Employee.num_of_emps makes much more sense than self.num_of_emps

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)

    # ClassMethod
    @classmethod
    def set_raise_amt(cls, amount):
        cls.raise_amt = amount

    # ClassMethod as alternative constructor
    @classmethod
    def from_string(cls, emp_str):
        first, last, pay = emp_str.split('-')
        return cls(first, last, int(pay))

    # StaticMethod
    @staticmethod
    def is_workday(day):
        if day.weekday() == 5 or day.weekday() == 6:
            return False
        else:
            return True

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 50000)
# employee information as string
emp_str_1 = 'John-Cena-10000'
emp_str_2 = 'Lionel-Messi-60000'
emp_str_3 = 'Matt-Murdock-30000'
```

Now, if we aren't sure whether a method should be a static or class, just think about if the method needs to be accessed from a Class/Instance, if it doesn't, it is most likely a `staticmethod`.

Let's try to check if code works:


```python
import datetime
my_date = datetime.date(2019, 3, 5) # This is a Tuesday

print(Employee.is_workday(my_date))
```

    True


# Inheritance & Creating SubClasses

Inheritance allows us to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class.

This is useful because we can create subclasses and get all of the functionality of our parents class, and have the ability to overwrite or add completely new functionality without affecting the parents class in any ways.


```python
# Python OOP

class Employee:

    # Class variable
    num_of_emps = 0
    raise_amt = 1.04 # raise_amount is a class variable

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

        Employee.num_of_emps += 1 # Employee.num_of_emps makes much more sense than self.num_of_emps

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)
```

suppose we want to create `Manager` & `Developer` subclasses, by using the concept of inheritance, we can inherit all the functionalities from `Employee` class.


```python
# This creates Developer subclass
class Developer(Employee):
    pass
```


```python
# Instantiate developers
dev_1 = Developer('Maxim', 'Nawangwe', 60000)
dev_2 = Developer('Ronnie', 'Liew', 55000)

print(dev_1.email)
print(dev_2.email)
```

    Maxim.Nawangwe@unemployed.com
    Ronnie.Liew@unemployed.com


The developers email have been successfully printed, the attribute email was set in parent `employee` class. So what happened?

Basically, when we instantiated our developers, it first look at the `Developer` class to search for `__init__` constructor method, and since it could not find any, it will then search up the chain of inheritance. This process is known as **method resolution order (MRO)**.


```python
# Let's visualize the method resolution order
print(help(Developer))
```

    Help on class Developer in module __main__:

    class Developer(Employee)
     |  Method resolution order:
     |      Developer
     |      Employee
     |      builtins.object
     |  
     |  Methods inherited from Employee:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, first, last, pay)
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
     |  
     |  apply_raise(self)
     |      # Instance Method
     |  
     |  fullname(self)
     |      # Instance Method
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Data descriptors inherited from Employee:
     |  
     |  __dict__
     |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
     |  
     |  __weakref__
     |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Data and other attributes inherited from Employee:
     |  
     |  num_of_emps = 2
     |  
     |  raise_amt = 1.04

    None


Suppose developer gets a higher raise, you can see the **MRO** in action, it will first look at the `developer` subclass to check if there's any raise_amt variable.


```python
# Python OOP

class Employee:

    # Class variable
    num_of_emps = 0
    raise_amt = 1.04 # raise_amount is a class variable

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

        Employee.num_of_emps += 1 # Employee.num_of_emps makes much more sense than self.num_of_emps

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amt)

# This creates Developer subclass
class Developer(Employee):
    raise_amt = 1.10
```


```python
# Instantiate developers
dev_1 = Developer('Maxim', 'Nawangwe', 60000)
dev_2 = Developer('Ronnie', 'Liew', 55000)

print(dev_2.pay)
dev_2.apply_raise()
print(dev_2.pay)
```

    55000
    60500


Now, say we also want to pass in main programming language used by our developers as attributes, but the `Employee` class does not have that attribute, so we would have to write a constructor method for the `Developer` subclass.

When we are writing the constructor method for the `Developer` subclass, we realize that we are using attributes that are in the `Employee` class (e.g. first, last, pay) and a new attribute, `prog_lang` is created specifically for `Developer` subclass, instead of copying and pasting all the codes from `Employee` class, we can use `super().__init__()`.


```python
# Python OOP

class Employee:

    # Class variable
    num_of_emps = 0
    raise_amt = 1.04 # raise_amount is a class variable

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

        Employee.num_of_emps += 1 # Employee.num_of_emps makes much more sense than self.num_of_emps

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amt)

# This creates Developer subclass
class Developer(Employee):
    raise_amt = 1.10

    def __init__(self, first, last, pay, prog_lang):
        super().__init__(first, last, pay)
        self.prog_lang = prog_lang
```


```python
# Instantiate developers
dev_1 = Developer('Maxim', 'Nawangwe', 60000, 'C++' )
dev_2 = Developer('Ronnie', 'Liew', 55000, 'Java')

print(dev_1.email)
print(dev_1.prog_lang)
```

    C++


Let's practice creating another subclass `Manager`, because practice makes perfect.


```python
class Manager(Employee):

        def __init__(self, first, last, pay, employees = None):
            super().__init__(first, last, pay)
            if employees is None:
                self.employees = []
            else:
                self.employees = employees

        # add employee method
        def add_emp(self, emp):
            if emp not in self.employees:
                self.employees.append(emp)

        # remove employee method
        def remove_emp(self, emp):
            if emp in self.employees:
                self.employees.remove(emp)

        # print employee method
        def print_emps(self):
            for emp in self.employees:
                print('-->', emp.fullname())
```


```python
mgr_1 = Manager('Jurgen', 'Klopp', 100000, [dev_1])

print(mgr_1.email)
```

    Jurgen.Klopp@unemployed.com


E-mail of the manager is printed, this shows Manager class successfully inherited from Employee Class since email was not defined within Manager class

Let's see if we can get the method within the Manager class to work, try to print the employee name who is under the manager.


```python
mgr_1.print_emps()
```

    --> Maxim Nawangwe


Let's try removing existing developer and adding another employee for this manager to supervise.


```python
mgr_1.add_emp(dev_2)
mgr_1.remove_emp(dev_1)
mgr_1.print_emps()
```

    --> Ronnie Liew


Sweet, before we wrap it up, let's talk about two built-in functions in Python, `isinstance` and `issubclass`


```python
# This tells if an instance is an instance of a class
print(isinstance(mgr_1, Manager))
print(isinstance(mgr_1, Employee))
print(isinstance(mgr_1, Developer))
```

    True
    True
    False


mgr_1 is an instance of `Manager` class, but is also an instance of `Employee` class because `Manager` class inherited from `Employee` class.

Now, mgr_1 isn't an instance of `Developer` class, because they aren't part of each others inheritance.


```python
print(issubclass(Developer, Employee))
print(issubclass(Manager, Employee))
print(issubclass(Developer, Manager))
```

    True
    True
    False


The results are expected, `Developer` is a subclass of `Employee` and not subclass of `Developer`.

To sum it up, we have learnt the following from the previous blogpost and this blogpost (highlighted are from this blogpost)
- Different terminology:
    - *Class (i.e. Employee)*
    - *Instance/object of the class (i.e. emp_1, emp_2)*
    - *Instance Variables / Attributes (i.e. first, last, pay, email.)*
    - *Class Variables (i.e. raise_amount, num_of_emps)*
    - *Instance Method (i.e. fullname, apply_raise)*
    - ***Class Method (i.e. set_raise_amt, from_string***)
    - ***Static Method (i.e. isworkday)***
    - ***Subclass (i.e. Developer, Manager)***
    - ***Inheritance (i.e. Developer(Employee))***
    - ***Method Resolution Order***
- Creating a simple class by creating constructor method (e.g. `__init__(...)`) and create methods (e.g. `fullname(self)`)
- When to use *self* and *class* within a method
- **When to use define Instance Method vs Class Method**
- **Using Class Method as alternative constructor (i.e. from_string)**
- **Creating Subclass and using `super().__init__(...)`**
- **Creating Methods within a Subclass**

I am done for now, and in the next blogpost, I will explore special methods in Python, some people prefer to call it magic, not even kidding. After that, I will learn about property decorators in Python.

When the knowledge gap is filled, I would resume my machine learning project in predicting housing prices in the early 90s.
Fingers crossed it will be up by the end of the week!
