As mentioned in my previous progress update, I was struggling with the idea of building custom transformers in one of my machine learning projects, and because of that, I have decided to learn Object Oriented Programming in Python before I resume my machine learning project.

Object-oriented programming allows for variables to be used at the class level or the instance level.

Variables are essentially symbols that stand in for a value youâ€™re using in a program.

Object-oriented programming adheres to the **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principle as it reduces redundancy (i.e. limiting repetition within code).

## Classes & Instances


```python
# Python Object-Oriented Programming

# Employee class with no attributes or methods
class Employee:
    pass
```

Class is basically a blueprint for creating instances, and each unique employee that we create using our employee class will be an instance of that class


```python
# emp_1 is an instance of Employee Class, emp_2 is another instance of Employee Class
emp_1 = Employee()
emp_2 = Employee()

print(emp_1)
print(emp_2)
```

As seen from above, both *emp1* and *emp2* are **Instances (a.k.a Objects)** of the **Employee Class**, and they are both unique in two different locations in the memory.

**Instance variables (a.k.a Attributes)** contain Data that is unique to each instance. For example, *first, last, email, pay* are all instance variables.


```python
# Manually creating instance variable
emp_1.first = 'Cody'
emp_1.last = 'Lian'
emp_1.email = 'Cody.Lian@unemployed.com'
emp_1.pay = 10000

emp_2.first = 'Test'
emp_2.last = 'User'
emp_2.email = 'Test.User@unemployed.com'
emp_2.pay = 20000
```


```python
print(emp_1.email)
print(emp_2.email)
```

    Cody.Lian@unemployed.com
    Test.User@unemployed.com


Let's say we want to set all the information when they are created, rather than doing it manually. To automate this process, we use `__init__` method, when we create methods within a class, they receive the instance as the first argument automatically, and by convention, we call the instance *self*.


```python
# Automate the process of creating instance variable

class Employee:

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'
```


```python
emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 60000)
```


```python
print(emp_1.email)
print(emp_2.email)
```

    Cody.Lian@unemployed.com
    Test.User@unemployed.com


By doing this, we do not have to manually type the instance variables of our class (e.g. first, last, pay, email) everytime we want to register a new employee information.

Now, lets say we want to display the employee full name, but we do not want to manually type it everytime like below.


```python
print('{} {}'.format(emp_1.first, emp_1.last))
```

    Cody Lian


Let's create a method within our class that allows us to put this functionality in one place.


```python
class Employee:

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last and pay
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)
```


```python
emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 60000)
```


```python
# we have to put () because this is a method and not an attribute
print(emp_1.fullname())
```

    Cody Lian



```python
# we can also run these methods using the class name itself
Employee.fullname(emp_1)
```




    'Cody Lian'



## Class Variables

Class variables are variables that are shared amongst all instances of the class.

So while instance variables can be unique for each instance (e.g. name, pay, email), class variables should be the same for each instance.

For example, let's say that the company gives annual raises every year, the amount can change every year, but its the same for every employee, so its a good candidate for a class variables.


```python
class Employee:

    # Constructor Method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * 1.04)

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 60000)
```


```python
print('Before raise:', emp_1.pay)
emp_1.apply_raise()
print('After raise:', emp_1.pay)
```

    Before raise: 10000
    After raise: 10400


Problem with the above implementation is that we would have to manually check the instance method within the class everytime we want to update the increment rate.

That's why we pull the rate out to be a class variable.


```python
class Employee:

    # Class variable
    raise_amount = 1.04 # raise_amount is a class variable

    # Constructor Method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 60000)
```

Notice how we are accessing our class variable from an instance `self.raise_amount` and not `Employee.raise_amount`, why is that the case?


```python
print(Employee.raise_amount) # accessing class variable from class
print(emp_1.raise_amount) # accessing class variable from instance
print(emp_2.raise_amount) # accessing class variable from instance
```

    1.04
    1.04
    1.04


When we try to access an attribute on an instance, it will first check if the instance contains that attribute, if it doesn't, it will then check if the class or any class that it inherits from containts that attribute.

Let's say employee 1 did a great job, and received a greater raise amount (e.g. 10%).


```python
emp_1.raise_amount = 1.05

print(Employee.raise_amount) # accessing class variable from class
print(emp_1.raise_amount) # accessing class variable from instance
print(emp_2.raise_amount) # accessing class variable from instance
```

    1.04
    1.05
    1.04



```python
print(emp_1.__dict__) # emp_1 found the attribute raise_amount = 1.05, before searching in the class variable
print(emp_2.__dict__) # emp_2 could not find the attribute raise_amount, so it searchs for it in the class variable
```

    {'first': 'Cody', 'last': 'Lian', 'pay': 10000, 'email': 'Cody.Lian@unemployed.com', 'raise_amount': 1.05}
    {'first': 'Test', 'last': 'User', 'pay': 60000, 'email': 'Test.User@unemployed.com'}


This explains the reason for using `self.raise_amount` instead of `Employee.raise_amount` in the `apply_raise` method:

- gives us the flexibility to change the raise amount for any of our instances.
- In additon, using `self.raise_amount` would also allow any subclass to override the constant if needed. (We will come back to this in upcoming blog posts)

There are however cases when it makes sense to use the `Employee class` instead of `self instance`. Let's say we want to keep track of how many employees we have:


```python
class Employee:

    # Class variable
    num_of_emps = 0
    raise_amount = 1.04 # raise_amount is a class variable

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

        Employee.num_of_emps += 1 # Employee.num_of_emps makes much more sense than self.num_of_emps

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amount)

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 50000)
emp_3 = Employee('Elon', 'Musk', 9999999) # You wish :)
```


```python
print(Employee.num_of_emps)
```

In a nutshell, we should be familiar with the following:
- Different terminology
    - *Class (i.e. Employee)*
    - *Instance/object of the class (i.e. emp_1, emp_2)*
    - *Instance Variables / Attributes (i.e. first, last, pay, email.)*
    - *Class Variables (i.e. raise_amount, num_of_emps)*
    - *Instance Method (i.e. fullname, apply_raise)*
- Creating a simple class by creating constructor method (e.g. `__init__(...)`) and create methods (e.g. `fullname(self)`)
- When to use *self* and *class* within a method

Well, that's more than 10 hours of staring at the laptop (progress update, adjust website interface, intro to OOP in Python).

I will be exploring *Class Methods such as static methods & class methods* tomorrow and will update my learning on my blog, have a good night!
