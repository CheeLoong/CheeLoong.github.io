## 2019-03-02: Superhero landing on GitHub.io

After months of doing data science projects on my local workspace, I've finally created a blog to dedicate my lifelong learning as an associate data scientist (maybe some personal stories too)

I am currently reading **Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow** by Aurelien Geron and as a start, I would like to upload my learning from the book on this website, to help me get used to publishing my work in Jupyter Notebook via Atom & GitHub.

Well, I am going to watch some Netflix and go to bed. I will see you tomorrow.
