# Special Methods

In this blogpost, we will talk about special methods that we can use within our classes.

These special methods allow us to emulate some built-in behaviour within Python and it's also how we implement **operator overloading**, which is the process of defining methods for operators (e.g. `__add__()`)

Let's continue with out previous example, the `Employee` class:


```python
class Employee:

    # Class variable
    num_of_emps = 0
    raise_amt = 1.04 # raise_amount is a class variable

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

        Employee.num_of_emps += 1 # Employee.num_of_emps makes much more sense than self.num_of_emps

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amt)

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 50000)
```


```python
# For example
print(emp_1)
```

    <__main__.Employee object at 0x102f6b0f0>


When we print emp_1 instance, we get a vague Employee object, and we would like to improve the readability of the output. To do that,  we can define our own special methods that will change some of the built-in behaviour and operations.  These special methods are always surrounded by `__` (a.k.a. Dunder). For example, one of the most common special methods is the special dunder init constructor method `__init__(...)`.

Another two special methods would be `__repr__()` and `__str__()`, In short, `__repr__()` is meant to be an unambiguous representation of the object and should be used for debugging and logging and things like that (It's to be seen by other developers). `__str__()` on the other hand, is meant to be a more readable representation of the object and used to be display for the end-user.


```python
class Employee:

    # Class variable
    num_of_emps = 0
    raise_amt = 1.04 # raise_amount is a class variable

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

        Employee.num_of_emps += 1 # Employee.num_of_emps makes much more sense than self.num_of_emps

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amt)

    # Special Method repr (For developer)
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Employee('{}', '{}', '{}')".format(self.first, self.last, self.pay)

    # Special Method str (For end user)
    def __str__(self):
        return '{} - {}'.format(self.fullname(), self.email)

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 50000)
```


```python
print(emp_1) # This print outputs __str__, if its n/a, it will output __repr__
```

    Cody Lian - Cody.Lian@unemployed.com



```python
# But we can still access to repr if we wish to
print(emp_1.__repr__())
print(emp_1.__str__())
```

    Employee('Cody', 'Lian', '10000')
    Cody Lian - Cody.Lian@unemployed.com


Remember, when we are writing classes, these 3 special methods (`__init__()`, `__repr__()`, `__str__`) will be used most often. But it doesn't hurt to learn a few more special methods.


```python
print(4 + 5) # This is using special method called __add__()
print(int.__add__(4,5)) # Access the special method add directly using 'int' class
print(str.__add__('James', 'Bond')) # Access the special method add directly using 'str' class
```

 So, we can actually customize how addition works for our objects by creating that `__add__` method.

Let's pretend we want to calculate total salaries just by adding employee together, and also to calculate the length of our employees' full name.


```python
class Employee:

    # Class variable
    num_of_emps = 0
    raise_amt = 1.04 # raise_amount is a class variable

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

        Employee.num_of_emps += 1 # Employee.num_of_emps makes much more sense than self.num_of_emps

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def apply_raise(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amt)

    # Special Method repr (For developer)
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Employee('{}', '{}', '{}')".format(self.first, self.last, self.pay)

    # Special Method str (For end user)
    def __str__(self):
        return '{} - {}'.format(self.fullname(), self.email)

    # Special Method add
    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.pay + other.pay

    # Special Method len
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.fullname())

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 50000)
```


```python
print(emp_1.__len__())
```

# Property Decorators

Property decorators give our class attributes; getter, setter, deleters functionalities. Now, how does it work?

## Getter


```python
class Employee:

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@unemployed.com'

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 50000)
```


```python
# everything is working as intended
print(emp_1.first)
print(emp_1.email)
print(emp_1.fullname())
```

    Cody
    Cody.Lian@unemployed.com
    Cody Lian



```python
# let's update emp_1 and reprint the results
emp_1.first = 'John'

print(emp_1.first)
print(emp_1.email)
print(emp_1.fullname())
```

    John
    Cody.Lian@unemployed.com
    John Lian


Notice that when we update our employee first name, the email does not get updated, this is because the email was still using the old instance variable. How do we fix it such that everytime we update the first name or last name, the e-mail gets updated automatically?

We can consider the creating an instance method, just like the `fullname` to ensure email gets updated automatically.


```python
class Employee:

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay

    # Instance Method
    def email(self):
        return '{}.{}@unemployed.com'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Test', 'User', 50000)
```


```python
# let's update emp_1 and reprint the results
emp_1.first = 'John'

print(emp_1.first)
print(emp_1.email())
print(emp_1.fullname())
```

    John.Lian@unemployed.com
    John Lian


Awesome, we did it! Not really, because this will break the code for everyone currently using the `Employee` class. What do I mean by that?

`email` was previously an attribute, and we access it like an attribute (i.e. `emp_1.email`), but now that it is defined as a method, we have to access it like a method (i.e. `emp_1.email()`), sounds like a lot of work.

This is where getter and setter comes in handy, to access them, we use the property decorators in Python (Basically, it allows us to define a method but we can access it like an attribute). Perfect for our current situation.


```python
class Employee:

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay

    # Property decorator
    @property
    def email(self):
        return '{}.{}@unemployed.com'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
```


```python
# let's update emp_1 and reprint the results
emp_1.first = 'John'

print(emp_1.first) # attribute
print(emp_1.email) # instance method but accessible like an attribute
print(emp_1.fullname()) # instance method
```

    John
    John.Lian@unemployed.com
    John Lian


## Setter

Sweet! Suppose we want to reverse enginneer the process by updating the fullname, and hoping that everything else get updated too, let's try it!


```python
emp_1.fullname = 'Tony Stark' # Update emp_1 fullname

print(emp_1.first) # This did not print Tony :(
print(emp_1.email) # This did not print Tony.Stark@unemployed.com :(
```

    John
    John.Lian@unemployed.com


Easy, just use **setter**.


```python
class Employee:

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay

    # Property decorator
    @property
    def email(self):
        return '{}.{}@unemployed.com'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    @property
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Setter to the rescue!
    @fullname.setter
    def fullname(self, name):
        first, last = name.split(' ')
        self.first = first
        self.last = last

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
```


```python
emp_1.fullname = 'Tony Stark' # Update emp_1 fullname

print(emp_1.first) # This prints Tony :)
print(emp_1.email) # This prints Tony.Stark@unemployed.com :)
```

    Tony
    Tony.Stark@unemployed.com


## Deleters

We can also make a **deleter** in the same way as **setter**.

Suppose if we delete the full name of an employee, the other information associated with that employee gets deleted as well.


```python
class Employee:

    # Constructor method with instance variables first, last, pay, email
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay

    # Property decorator
    @property
    def email(self):
        return '{}.{}@unemployed.com'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Instance Method
    @property
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)

    # Setter
    @fullname.setter
    def fullname(self, name):
        self.first, self.last = name.split(' ')

    # Deleter
    @fullname.deleter
    def fullname(self):
        print('{} Name Deleted!'.format(self.fullname))
        del self.first
        del self.last

emp_1 = Employee('Cody', 'Lian', 10000)
emp_2 = Employee('Thor', 'Odinson', 30000)
```


```python
del emp_1.fullname # emp_1 fullname deleted

print(emp_2.first)
print(emp_2.email)
```

    Cody Lian Name Deleted!
    Thor
    Thor.Odinson@unemployed.com



```python
print(emp_1.first) # does not print because of the deleter
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-21-70990d12f6df> in <module>

    AttributeError: 'Employee' object has no attribute 'first'


Alright, this concludes our learning for the OOP in Python, we have learnt the following from the previous blogpost and this blogpost (highlighted are from this blogpost)
- Different terminology:
    - *Class (i.e. Employee)*
    - *Instance/object of the class (i.e. emp_1, emp_2)*
    - *Instance Variables / Attributes (i.e. first, last, pay, email.)*
    - *Class Variables (i.e. raise_amount, num_of_emps)*
    - *Instance Method (i.e. fullname, apply_raise)*
    - *Class Method (i.e. set_raise_amt, from_string)*
    - *Static Method (i.e. isworkday)*
    - *Subclass (i.e. Developer, Manager)*
    - *Inheritance (i.e. Developer(Employee))*
    - *Method Resolution Order*
    - ***Special Methods (e.g. `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__str__`)***
    - ***Property Decorators (i.e. getter, setter, deleter)***
- Creating a simple class by creating constructor method (e.g. `__init__(...)`) and create methods (e.g. `fullname(self)`)
- When to use *self* and *class* within a method
- When to use define Instance Method vs Class Method
- Using Class Method as alternative constructor (i.e. from_string)
- Creating Subclass and using `super().__init__(...)`
- Creating Methods within a Subclass
- **Using Special Methods to modify built-in behaviour within Python (e.g. changing the built-in output of an instance)**
- **Using Special Methods for operator overloading (e.g. `__add__`, `__len__`)**
- **Using Property Decorators to treat a method like an attribute**
- **Using Property Decorators to manipulate the attributes by modifying the instance method (e.g. deletion of full name would delete first and last name instances)**

Here's the materials that I use to learn about OOP in Python, highly recommended!
- [Corey Schafer's Python OOP Tutorial Youtube Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM&list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc&index=1)
- [OOP in Python 3](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)
- [Do Data Scientists use OOP?](https://www.quora.com/Do-data-scientists-use-object-oriented-programming)
- [More Special Methods](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types)
- [Operator Overloading](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-in-python/)

Okay, now that I've done with OOP in Python, I will most likely resume my machine learning project, or learn something else, I am not entirely sure yet.

Anyhow, it will be up tomorrow! :)
