**What is NLP?**

It's abbreviation for Natural Language Processing. Itâ€™s about taking text data, and doing some classification with it, it has various applications, to name a few, it could be about sentiment analysis (i.e. identifying positive or negative comments), spam prevention (e.g identifying spam or ham in our email inbox), or identifying fake news on social media sites.  

**What about Sentiment Analysis?**

In this IMDB dataset, we will be trying to identifying viewers' sentiment about a movie (i.e. good feedback or negative feedback), the dataset is captured from a subset of the user reviews and movies on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/).


# Colab Cloud Server VM setup & FastAI Configurations

First we need to use GPU for deep learning applications, so instead of buying, we can rent it from cloud servers. There are many other server options, but basically I chose Colab because issa FREE.

To learn how to set up a Colab Server which supports fastai library and its applications, click [here](https://course.fast.ai/start_colab.html).

NB: This is a free service that may not always be available, and requires extra steps to ensure your work is saved. Be sure to read the docs on the Colab web-site to ensure you understand the limitations of the system.

# Let's Talk Data

First let's download the dataset we are going to study. The [dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) has been curated by Andrew Maas et al. and contains a total of 100,000 reviews on IMDB. 25,000 of them are labelled as positive and negative for training, another 25,000 are labelled for testing (in both cases they are highly polarized). The remaining 50,000 is an additional unlabelled data (but we will find a use for it nonetheless).

We'll begin with a sample we've prepared for you, so that things run quickly before going over the full dataset.

## Getting the Data


```python
path = untar_data(URLs.IMDB_SAMPLE)
path.ls()
```




    [PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb_sample/texts.csv')]



It only contains one csv file, let's have a look at it.


```python
df = pd.read_csv(path/'texts.csv')
df.head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">

      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>False</td>

      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>

      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

</div>




```python
# import `textwrap` library for text-wrapping on Colab
import textwrap as wrap
```


```python
# print the movie review from 2nd row and its label
print(wrap.fill(df['text'][1], width=120))
print()
print('label:', df['label'][1])
```

    This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too,
    though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the
    cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is
    hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the
    British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is
    some merit in this view, but it's also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other
    as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the
    religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty
    and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never
    painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the
    younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a
    man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking
    for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the
    message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The
    reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across
    the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to "Mr & Mrs Iyer".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have
    seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of
    racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.

    label: positive


It contains one line per review, with the label ('negative' or 'positive'), the text and a flag to determine if it should be part of the validation set or the training set. If we ignore this flag, we can create a DataBunch containing this data in one line of code:

## Creating `DataBunch` object with default factory method `TextDataBunch`

This step is very important, regardless of what kind of dataset we are using, in order to do modelling with fastai, we first need to convert the dataset to a `DataBunch` object.

For this subsection, we will be using a default factory method `TextDataBunch` to convert the dataset to a `DataBunch` object.

`TextDataBunch` is basically a general class to create a `DataBunch` object for NLP, and it is subclassed by `TextLMDataBunch` and `TextClasDataBunch`.

Read more [here](https://docs.fast.ai/text.data.html#Quickly-assemble-your-data).


```python
data_lm = TextDataBunch.from_csv(path, 'texts.csv')
```

By executing this line a process was launched that took a bit of time. Let's dig a bit into it. Images could be fed (almost) directly into a model because they're just a big array of pixel values that are floats between 0 and 1. A text is composed of words, and we can't apply mathematical functions to them directly. We first have to convert them to numbers.

This is done in two differents steps: **tokenization and numericalization**. A `TextDataBunch` does all of that behind the scenes for you.

Before we delve into the explanations, let's take the time to save the things that were calculated.


```python
# this export a model called `data_save.pkl' in path
data_lm.save()
```

Next time we launch this notebook, we can skip the cell above that took a bit of time (and that will take a lot more when you get to the full dataset) and load those results like this:


```python
data = load_data(path)
```

### What is Tokenization?

The first step of processing we make the texts go through is to split the raw sentences into words, or more exactly tokens. The easiest way to do this would be to split the string on spaces, but we can be smarter:

- we need to take care of punctuation
- some words are contractions of two different words, like isn't or don't
- we may need to clean some parts of our texts, if there's HTML code for instance

To see what the tokenizer had done behind the scenes, let's have a look at a few texts in a batch.


```python
data = TextClasDataBunch.from_csv(path, 'texts.csv')
data.show_batch()
```


<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>text</th>
      <th>target</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>xxbos xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas : a xxmaj review \n \n  xxmaj you know , xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is like sticking your hands into a big , xxunk bowl of xxunk . xxmaj it 's warm and gooey , but you 're not sure if it feels right . xxmaj try as i might , no matter how warm and gooey xxmaj raising xxmaj</td>
      <td>negative</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>xxbos xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is one of the sweetest and most feel - good romantic comedies ever made . xxmaj there 's just no getting around that , and it 's hard to actually put one 's feeling for this film into words . xxmaj it 's not one of those films that tries too hard , nor does it come up with</td>
      <td>positive</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>xxbos xxmaj now that xxmaj che(2008 ) has finished its relatively short xxmaj australian cinema run ( extremely limited xxunk screen in xxmaj sydney , after xxunk ) , i can xxunk join both xxunk of " xxmaj at xxmaj the xxmaj movies " in taking xxmaj steven xxmaj soderbergh to task . \n \n  xxmaj it 's usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style /</td>
      <td>negative</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>xxbos xxmaj this film sat on my xxmaj tivo for weeks before i watched it . i dreaded a self - indulgent xxunk flick about relationships gone bad . i was wrong ; this was an xxunk xxunk into the screwed - up xxunk of xxmaj new xxmaj yorkers . \n \n  xxmaj the format is the same as xxmaj max xxmaj xxunk ' " xxmaj la xxmaj ronde</td>
      <td>positive</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>xxbos xxmaj many neglect that this is n't just a classic due to the fact that it 's the first xxup 3d game , or even the first xxunk - up . xxmaj it 's also one of the first stealth games , one of the xxunk definitely the first ) truly claustrophobic games , and just a pretty well - rounded gaming experience in general . xxmaj with graphics</td>
      <td>positive</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


The texts are truncated at 100 tokens for more readability. We can see that it did more than just split on space and punctuation symbols:
- the "'s" are grouped together in one token
- the contractions are separated like this: "did", "n't"
- content has been cleaned for any HTML symbol and lower cased
- there are several special tokens (all those that begin by xx), to replace unknown tokens (see below) or to introduce different text fields (here we only have one).

### What is Numericalization?

Once we have extracted tokens from our texts, we convert to integers by creating a list of all the words used. We only keep the ones that appear at least twice with a maximum vocabulary size of 60,000 (by default) and replace the ones that don't make the cut by the unknown token `UNK`.

The correspondance from ids to tokens is stored in the `vocab` attribute of our datasets, in a dictionary called `itos` (for int to string).


```python
data.vocab.itos[:10]
```




    ['xxunk',
     'xxpad',
     'xxbos',
     'xxeos',
     'xxfld',
     'xxmaj',
     'xxup',
     'xxrep',
     'xxwrep',
     'the']



And if we look at what a what's in our datasets, we'll see the tokenized text as a representation:


```python
print(wrap.fill(str(data.train_ds[0][0]),width=120))
```

    xxbos xxmaj like wearing a hair shirt . xxmaj positively , absolutely , without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst
    movies ever . xxmaj pure torture . xxmaj zero stars out of ten . xxmaj one long , tedious , xxunk , pretentious , self -
    conscious , theatrical , and xxunk artsy scene after another . xxmaj intended to be xxunk and xxunk , the soul xxunk ,
    it is , instead , xxunk mush .      xxmaj half - naked , father and son xxunk and xxunk to each other like lovers . "
    xxmaj homo - erotic " is the point , loud and clear . xxup ok , so what ?      xxmaj repeated more than once by the son
    is the line , supposedly lifted from " xxmaj lives of the xxmaj saints , " " a father 's love xxunk . a loving son lets
    himself be xxunk . " xxmaj the parallel to god and his son , xxmaj christ , is heavy - handed , irrelevant , and xxunk ,
    like everything else here .      xxmaj some reference points to the theme of xxmaj russian xxunk : " xxmaj mother and
    xxmaj son " ( 1997 ) ; " xxmaj the xxmaj return " ( xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , 2003 ) ; " xxmaj little xxmaj odessa " (
    xxmaj james xxmaj xxunk ) ; xxmaj xxunk , " xxmaj fathers and xxmaj sons " ; and , of course , xxmaj xxunk , " xxmaj the
    xxmaj brothers xxmaj xxunk . "      xxmaj credits in xxmaj english indicate intended international distribution ,
    meaning that the excuse can not be used that you have to be xxmaj russian to understand this mess .      xxmaj this is
    nowhere near as accomplished or compelling as xxmaj xxunk 's last , " xxmaj russian xxmaj ark " ( 2003 ) .      xxmaj as
    in his " xxmaj mother and xxmaj son , " an equally powerful xxunk , some scenes are filmed from xxunk mirrors , though
    not as interestingly . xxmaj the film is almost xxunk , shot from start to finish through xxunk xxunk , making it as
    visually as it is dramatically numbing . a soft - focus xxunk only adds to the drugged feeling .      xxmaj an annoying
    soundtrack drones on , never xxunk up , like a tape loop . xxmaj an old radio constantly plays in the background . xxmaj
    russian xxmaj romantic melancholy swells endlessly as " themes based on xxmaj tchaikovsky . " xxmaj the presence of a "
    sound designer " ( xxmaj sergei xxmaj xxunk ) xxunk , of course , that all those irritating little sounds , radio static
    , noises , distortion , and such , are " designed . "      xxmaj it 's hard to believe someone ( xxmaj sergei xxmaj
    xxunk ) actually wrote this thing . xxmaj it all seems as arbitrary as traffic , as if improvised by bored actors ,
    popping out of nothingness into nothingness .      xxmaj modern art has finally succeeded in xxunk the thing without
    being the thing , so that what we behold is the idea of the idea , empty as a shell , but not even a shell , merely the
    idea of a shell . xxmaj could one ask for a better definition of decadence ?



```python
data.train_ds[0][0].data[:10]
```




    array([   2,    5,   50, 1594,   13,  867, 1494,   11,    5, 3834])



## Creating `DataBunch` object with the data block API

In practice though, we will most likely be using the [data block API](https://docs.fast.ai/data_block.html) with NLP so that we get to have a lot more flexibility than what the previous default factory methods has to offer.

- In the previous example, the data was randomly split between train and validation instead of reading the third column of the csv.
- Also, with data block API, we have to manually call the tokenize and numericalize steps, so if we are not using the defaults from fastai, the various arguments to pass will appear in the step that they are relevant, so it will be more readable.


For this case, we need to use `TextList`. This will make sure the model created has the proper loss function to deal with the multiple classes.


```python
data = (TextList.from_csv(path, 'texts.csv', cols='text')
       # Where are the text? Column 'text' of texts.csv
                .split_from_df(col=2)
        # split the data set via index 2 column
                .label_from_df(cols=0)
        # get the data set label via index 0 column
                .databunch())
        # create databunch
```

# Language model

So up to this point, we have converted our IMDb dataset into a `databunch` object, but before we toss it into a text classifier and have it tells us the user sentiment about a movie (i.e. postive or negative). We first need to build an English language model (LM) for the IMDb corpus.

![nlp_flow](https://forums.fast.ai/uploads/default/original/2X/7/75e1a633edda0d7625e88756461c5777ab12db2e.jpeg)

**What is a Language Model?**

- A language model is a model which predicts the next word in a sentence. To predict next word in a sentence you need to know quite a lot about the English language. Every single word you can try and predict the next word. So in a 2000 words movie review, there are 1999 opportunities to predict the next word.

- Autocomplete in Google Search and also in Gmail are some of the applications of Language Model.



**But why do we need a LM for this classification task?**

- Okay, here's the thing, we only have 25,000 movie reviews with a label (positive or negative), this is clearly not enough information for the machine to be good enough to recognize if a movie review is of positive or negative sentiment, user could also use sarcasm which can be very tricky for machine to understand. That is why we need a LM for the IMDb corpus, to know a bit about completing sentences (in english), prior to looking at the users' movie reviews.

**Alright, Let's build a LM, but how?**

- Well, we could build a LM from scratch, but ain't nobody got time for that and so we will utilize a technique called **transfer learning** to make our life easier.

- The basic idea of transfer learning is taking a pre-trained LM that has been trained on a large generic corpus (e.g. Wikipedia articles) and transfer it's knowledge to a target LM and fine tuning the weights after.

- Our source LM is the pre-trained [WikiText-103 LM (AWD LSTM)](https://einstein.ai/research/blog/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset) created by Stephen Merity at [Salesforce research](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/ai-research/the-wikitext-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/), and our target LM is the IMDb LM.



```python
# Note that language models can use a lot of GPU, so you may need to decrease batchsize here.
bs=48
```

Now let's grab the full dataset for what follows.


```python
path = untar_data(URLs.IMDB)
path.ls()
```




    [PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/tmp_clas'),
     PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/README'),
     PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/unsup'),
     PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/imdb.vocab'),
     PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/train'),
     PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/test'),
     PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/tmp_lm')]




```python
(path/'train').ls()
```




    [PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/train/unsupBow.feat'),
     PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/train/neg'),
     PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/train/labeledBow.feat'),
     PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb/train/pos')]



So we have got `train` folder to represent the train set and `test` folder to represent the test set, we also have `unsup` that represent the unsupervised set which contains the unlabelled user reviews.

As mentioned, we're not going to train a model that classifies the reviews from scratch. Like in computer vision, we'll use a model pretrained on a bigger dataset (a cleaned subset of wikipedia called [AWD LSTM](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyyGPP0TZ). That model has been trained to guess what the next word, its input being all the previous words. It has a recurrent structure and a hidden state that is updated each time it sees a new word. This hidden state thus contains information about the sentence up to that point.

We are going to use that 'knowledge' of the English language to build our classifier, but first, like for computer vision, we need to fine-tune the pretrained model to our particular dataset, This is because the English of the reviews left by people on IMDB isn't the same as the English of wikipedia, we'll need to adjust the parameters of our model by a little bit. Plus there might be some words that would be extremely common in the reviews dataset but would be barely present in wikipedia, and therefore might not be part of the vocabulary the model was trained on.

This is where the unlabelled data is going to be useful to us, as we can use it to fine-tune our model. Let's create our data object with the data block API (next line takes a few minutes).


```python
data_lm = (TextList.from_folder(path)
           # Inputs: all the text files in path
            .filter_by_folder(include=['train', 'test', 'unsup'])
           # We may have other temp folders that contain text files so we only keep what's in train and test
            .random_split_by_pct(0.1)
           # We randomly split and keep 10% (10,000 reviews) for validation
            .label_for_lm()           
           # Use the label for language model (i.e. the texts is its own labels)
            .databunch(bs=bs))
data_lm.save('data_lm.pkl')
```

Why do we use 10% validation when we already have the train and test set compiled for us? Because we want our language model to train on more data by concatenating train and test set, as long as we are not using the label from test set, its okay to do so.

We have to use a special kind of `TextDataBunch` for the language model, that ignores the labels (that's why we put 0 everywhere), will shuffle the texts at each epoch before concatenating them all together (only for training, we don't shuffle for the validation set) and will send batches that read that text in order with targets that are the next word in the sentence.

The line before being a bit long, we want to load quickly the final ids by using the following cell.


```python
data_lm = load_data(path, 'data_lm.pkl', bs=bs)
```


```python
# check the object type of 'data_lm'
type(data_lm)
```




    fastai.text.data.TextLMDataBunch




```python
# uncomment to create 'models' directory (for session reset only)
# folder = 'models'

# dest = path/folder
# dest.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```


```python
data_lm.show_batch()
```


<table border="1" class="dataframe">

We can then put this in a learner object very easily with a model loaded with the pretrained weights. They'll be downloaded the first time you'll execute the following line and stored in `~/.fastai/models/` (or elsewhere if you specified different paths in your config file).


```python
# args: data, pre-trained model, use number <1 to avoid underfitting
learn = language_model_learner(data_lm, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.3)
```

**`data_lm`:** This is the language model dataset which went through tokenization and numericalization and being converted to `TextLMDataBunch` object.

**`AWD_LSTM`:** This stands for ASGD Weight-Dropped LSTM and it is the language model for the WikiText-103.

**`drop_mult:`** This sets the amount of dropout, which will be talked about in future blogpost, for now just note that number <1 is used to avoid underfitting.

 `moms=(0.8,0.7)`ï¹£this sets momentums equals to `0.8 , 0.7`.  Basically, it really helps to decrease the momentum a little bit when training a recurrent neural network (RNNs), but we will explore more why this helps in the future.


```python
learn.save('fit_head')
```


```python
learn.load('fit_head');
```

What's happening here is we are just fine-tuning the last layers. Normally after we fine-tune the last layers, the next thing we do is we go `unfreeze` and train the whole thing. So here it is:


```python
learn.unfreeze()
```


```python
learn.fit_one_cycle(2, 1e-3, moms=(0.8,0.7))
```

Our accuracy is `0.3285`, so in another word, about 1/3 of the time, the model will correctly predict the next word of a sentence. It seems like a really low accuracy, but really it's good enough because now the model has some basic understanding about english language.


*Note: We are only allowing the learner the run for 2 epochs, and it has taken almost 3.33 hours, this is because we are renting a free version of GPU on Google Colab, and to save on computational expense, we are only running 2 epochs, I suggest to go for 10 epochs if we are on a more beefy GPU server. *


```python
# save the language model learner
learn.save('fine_tuned')
```


```python
# load the language model learner
learn.load('fine_tuned');
```

Let's demonstrate the capability of the language model with a simple movie review example, we will attempt to predict the next 40 words with the model for two times.


```python
# simple example of movie review
TEXT = "I liked this movie because"
N_WORDS = 40
N_SENTENCES = 2
```


```python
for _ in range(N_SENTENCES):
  print(wrap.fill(str((learn.predict(TEXT, N_WORDS, temperature=0.75))), width=120))
```

    I liked this movie because it was great , but i did not enjoy it . Also , i loved the characters and their story . It
    was a very good movie , but not for me . It was n't a
    I liked this movie because it is intelligent and funny . i think this movie has a lot of strong ideas . The acting is
    good and the story is good . i like this movie . i enjoyed the way it is presented


As we can see, the model isn't just generating random words here, it's trying to complete the sentences of our given text, although some part of it doesn't really make sense, but that's okay because our ultimate goal for this blogpost isn't to build a text generator system but rather a classifier telling us about user's sentiment about a movie.

At this point, we are happy that we have a IMDb language model, so now we're going to save that in order to load it into our classifier (i.e. to be a pre-trained model for the classifier). We not only have to save the model, but also it's encoder.


```python
# save the language model encoder
learn.save_encoder('fine_tuned_enc')
```

**What is an encoder in a LM?**

- A language model does 2 tasks, understanding the sentence, and also generating the next word of a given sentence.
- We want to save the IMDb LM in order to load it into our IMDb classifier (i.e. to be a pre-trained model for the classifier).
- But we are only interested in transfer learning for the first bit of the LM which is about understanding the sentence, and `encoder` (responsible for creating and updating the hidden state) does that, so we will just save that.


# Classifier

We are finally ready to create the IMDb Classifier to predict user's sentiment about movies, but first we will first create a new data object that only grabs the labelled data and keeps those labels. Again, this line takes a bit of time.


```python
# Update: Setting a lower bs because i ran out of memory on Colab (still failed)
# bs=32
```


```python
path = untar_data(URLs.IMDB)
```


```python
data_clas = (TextList.from_folder(path, vocab=data_lm.vocab)
             # grab all the text files in path
             .split_by_folder(valid='test')
             # split by train and valid folder (that only keeps 'train' and 'test' so no need to filter)
             .label_from_folder(classes=['neg', 'pos'])
             # label them all with their folders
             .databunch(bs=bs))

data_clas.save('data_clas.pkl')
```

`vocab=data_lm.vocab`: We want to make sure that the classifier uses exactly the same vocab that are used for the language model (e.g. number 10 was `the` in the language model's vocab, we need to make sure that word number 10 is also `the` in the classifier's vocab.


```python
path
```




    PosixPath('/root/.fastai/data/imdb')




```python
data_clas = load_data(path, 'data_clas.pkl', bs=bs)
```


```python
# check the object type of 'data_lm'
type(data_clas)
```




    fastai.text.data.TextClasDataBunch




```python
data_clas.show_batch()
```

We can then create a model to classify those reviews and load the encoder we saved before.


```python
learn = text_classifier_learner(data_clas, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.5)
learn.load_encoder('fine_tuned_enc')
```


```python
learn.lr_find()
```





    LR Finder is complete, type {learner_name}.recorder.plot() to see the graph.



```python
learn.recorder.plot(suggestion=True)
```

    Min numerical gradient: 1.45E-03

```

```python
learn.save('first')
```


```python
learn.load('first');
```

In these text classification, its helpful to not unfreeze the whole learner, but to unfreeze one layer at a time, that is why we unfreeze only the last 2 layers instead of all the layers, then we move on the unfreezing the last 3 layers, and then all layers.


```python
# unfreeze the last 2 layers
learn.freeze_to(-2)

# learn again
learn.fit_one_cycle(1, slice(1.45e-03/(2.6**4),1.45e-03), moms=(0.8,0.7))
```


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/imdb/output_04_0.png" alt="">




```python
learn.save('second')
```


```python
learn.load('second');
```


```python
learn.lr_find()
```





    LR Finder is complete, type {learner_name}.recorder.plot() to see the graph.



```python
learn.recorder.plot(suggestion=True)
```

    Min numerical gradient: 3.02E-05



<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/imdb/output_94_1.png" alt="">



```python
# unfreeze last 3 layers
learn.freeze_to(-3)
learn.fit_one_cycle(1, slice(1e-3/(2.6**4),1e-3), moms=(0.8,0.7))
```


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/imdb/output_05_0.png" alt="">




```python
learn.save('third')
```


```python
learn.load('third');
```


```python
learn.unfreeze()
learn.fit_one_cycle(2, slice(1e-3/(2.6**4),1e-3), moms=(0.8,0.7))
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/imdb/output_00_0.png" alt="">



*Note: Alright so I actually wasted A LOT of time trying to reset the runtime/ reducing the batch size, and It was all futile attempts, so I've decided to just stick with the model which has tuned the last 3 layers of the network, with an accuracy of `91.8%`, but if you are using/rent a beefy GPU server, feel free to run the code above as it will most probably give better accuracy.*


```python
# Reload the old learner, FeelsBadMan
learn.load('third')
```



Now let's see how good is our classifier in predicting my sentiment about a movie that I've watched recently.


```python
learn.predict("I thought I was never going to watch Transformers ever again, but I have to say, Bumblebee is an incredibly nice breath of fresh air compared to the previous Transformers movies directed by Michael Bay")
```




    (Category pos, tensor(1), tensor([0.0678, 0.9322]))



The model predicted the movie review to be positive with a probability of `93.22%`, that's pretty good because I tried to trick the model by including a slightly negative remark in the beginning of the movie review.

Let's try one more movie review with a little sarcasm.


```python
learn.predict("I am absolutely disgusted to learn about what Mark Zuckerberg did to create Facebook, but I have to say that the movie was brilliant.")
```




    (Category pos, tensor(1), tensor([0.4531, 0.5469]))



So the model is leaning more towards labelling the movie review as a positive review, but the probability was only `54.69%`, it's probably because of strong negative comments in the movie reviews (although it's not aiming towards the movie), but in the end, we got the right category, that is all that matters.

I have to emphasize that this blogpost took me a few days to get it up because the model was taking such a long time to train, and also because I am renting the GPU server, there's a lot of work to be done when the GPU is out of memory. In additional, this isn't a straight up 'lets build classifier' kind of problem, because we have to build the language model as well, which also took quite some time.

In a nutshell, I think It's quite disappoing that I could not showoff the best performance of this model due to computational expense, but I believe its good enough to handle most of the real life movie reviews. As usual thank you for reading the blog and credits to [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) for the resources.
