Here are some top FAQs that I get when human first met me.

***So why did you quit your previous job after 3 months of employment?***

If I had a time machine, I don't think I would ever quit my previous job (Because who would've guessed I would be unemployed for that long), but here's my thought process at that time. I pretty much got what everyone wanted from a job except that I didn't get the only thing that I cared about, which is the exposure in the technical field of data analytics, nothing satisfies me more than being able to transform data into actionable insights that can drive decisions that are valuable to the company, I want to be the guy who gets his hands dirty doing all that.

I don't hate being a data consultant, I just love it less than the other job, it was quite challenging for me to balance between my full time job and self-learning what I wanted to do, I work extra hours at my job even when it's not exactly my dream job. The reason is simple, if I finish my work early, I will be assigned more work, and that would help me learn more and progress faster.  

But at the end of the day, I sat down and had 2 reasonable considerations at that time, either I continue to work as a data consultant and wait for potential job opportunities to work as a data scientist, or leave my current job without any job opportunities in hand, which also makes my resume profile look really bad.

I opted for the second option, since I do not have strong technical background or working experience, it would be hard to get a "technical" job in the field, so rather than waiting for a very slim possibility of gaining technical working experience with my current job, I opted to create my own opportunities through sheer force of will and effort by self-learning the technical aspect of data analytics, and consequently, leaving my full time job.

It is a path that sounded logical to me, probably not to everyone else, I did not really question the probability of me landing on a technical job when I hand in the resignation letter, all I was thinking is that, to me that was the right thing to do, and even if odds were not in my favour, it's important enough.

***So what were you doing when you were unemployed?***

A lot of MOOCs, I learned a lot of traditional algorithm and methodologies, I went to a lot of DS interviews which I wasn't shortlisted (I guess traditional algorithm isn't good enough), but it did opened my eyes on the standard and qualities that the top companies are looking for from their candidates. I don't like to swim in the pool of self-pity for long, so I picked myself up and continue this journey, I received some advices from some DS on Linkedin, I watched a lot of 'how to get a job as DS' on Youtube, I read on various forums on the subject, piecing up the advices from all sources, decided to start deep learning, decided to start a blog and put learnings and my personal work on my blog, it's probably the biggest reason why I could turn all the adversities into fuel that keeps me going.

***Why should companies consider/hire you?***

I think it comes down to whether we have the same kind of vision for the future, if you ask me what should big companies be focusing at right now, I'd say Software 2.0, I would bet you a 'Teh O Ais Limau' that the future market leaders will be those who practice Software 2.0, in fact if you think about it, some of the most successful startups be it international or local are worth billions of dollars because of their emphasis on data and analytics, and believe it or not, they are already practicing Software 2.0.

Now, if you look at my projects, you will see what I learn, what I do on a regular basis, what I am passionate about, fall under the umbrella of Software 2.0. All that are not coincidental, I work hard for a future that I am excited about, not just for a paycheque that would buy me materialistic goods, if that is not a good enough reason for your company to consider me as a candidate, I don't know what is.
