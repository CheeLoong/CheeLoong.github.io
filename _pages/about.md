He is a **Finance & Econometrics** graduate of **Monash University Clayton University**. He's also a self-proclaimed driven, passionate data scientist, 26 years of age, going through quarter-life crisis, falls under the 3.3% of unemployed Malaysian in 2019. As tough as it sounds, it's really not that bad (you gotta look at the bright side of everything right?)

Anyway, He worked in a digital marketing firm known as **Crave Asia Sdn. Bhd**. for 15 months as a **digital analyst**, his main responsibilities were media budget optimization for social media adverts, identifying success metrics & tracking metrics for the digital campaign, and also writing post digital campaign reports. Then, He was hired by **Ernst & Young Services Sdn. Bhd.** as a **Date Scientist Associate**, but really he worked as a **Data Consultant**.

***I am glad you asked what does data consultant do!***

The less cool description is that there was a lot of meet ups with the key executives, a lot of Microsoft Powerpoint Presentation & Excel.

The slightly cooler version was that he was responsible for identifying the key performance indicators for BI, help compile the data warehouse architecture for data migration purpose, co-write analytics proposal and come up with use-cases.

***Seriously, you gotta speak about yourself in third person?***

Okay I thought that was kinda cool, my bad.

***So why did you quit?***

How can I begin to explain this without sounding like I am just a guy who is pushing responsibilities or giving excuses? To be honest, I can't, but I will try.

Looking back, I would admit that it was impulsive of me to quit the job after a period of 3 months (despite getting top performance reviews & job offer), everyone told me not to, a batch mate (although we were from different department) of mine also told me that I was the hardest worker he has met in the company, I had great colleagues, great leader, a very probable 'bright' future, and all it takes is *patience*.

But...

You see, I was stubborn, I was impatient, I want to do more, I feel that I am not living up to my own potential, and it's driving me crazy that I can't do what I was set to do. As a result, I took a huge risk that could lead to long term unemployment & criticism from friends and families, why?

***Why can't you be a date consultant, and be data scientist after?***

I definitely could, I could be a **data consultant** by day and a **data scientist in my room** by night, but I was overly committed to the company paying my coffee bill, I work extra hours to be better at what I do at work, it's just the way I am at work, I can't control that side of me.

***So what were you doing when you were unemployed?***

A lot of MOOCs, I learned a lot of outdated algorithm and methodologies, I went to a lot of DS interviews which I wasn't shortlisted, took a step back questioning my life, questioning decision, decided to be positive and move forward, got advices from different DS on Linkedin, watch a lot of 'how to get a job as DS' on Youtube, piecing up the advices from all sources, started deep learning, started blog, put learnings on blog as portfolio.
