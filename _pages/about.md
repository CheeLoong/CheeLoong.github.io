Whats Poppin'? My name is Chee Loong, some people call me Cody, some others call me good looking (hah..). I am a **Finance & Econometrics** graduate of **Monash University Clayton University**. I am also a self-proclaimed driven, passionate and good looking data scientist. I am 26 years of age, going through quarter-life crisis, and I also fall under the 3.3% of unemployed Malaysian in 2019. Sounds tough huh, but its a really a long story, let's just say I risk it for the biscuit, and I am still waiting to get that biscuit.

Random segue, so I worked in a digital marketing firm known as **Crave Asia Sdn. Bhd**. for 15 months as a **digital analyst**, my main responsibilities were media budget optimization for social media adverts, identifying success metrics & tracking metrics for the digital campaign, and also writing post digital campaign reports. Then, I worked as a **data scientist associate** in **Ernst & Young Services Sdn. Bhd.** for 3 months, I mainly help identifying the key performance indicators for BI, help compile the data warehouse architecture for data migration purpose, co-write analytics proposal and come up with use-cases.
