My name is Chee Loong, am a **Finance & Econometrics** graduate of **Monash University Clayton University**, also a self-proclaimed driven, passionate data scientist, 26 years of age. I worked in a digital marketing firm known as **Crave Asia Sdn. Bhd**. for in the year 2016 and 2017 as a **digital analyst**. Then, upon realizing where my passion lies, I left my comfort zone and self-taught DS skills.

Luckily for me, in 2018, I was hired by **Ernst & Young Services Sdn. Bhd.** as a **Data Scientist Associate**, but really I worked as a **Data Consultant**, so I was actually a data consultant by day and a data scientist by night, due to the amount of workload as a data consultant and the amount of expertise I have to pick up as a data scientist, I decided that it was best for me to pick one to focus on, and I picked the latter, I left my full time job to focus on learning the best practices and technologies that were used in the machine learning industry, one of my most recent learning would be the fast.ai library that specialize in the deep learning framework, most of my blogpost revolves around using fast.ai library to work on different analytics applications. click [here](https://cheeloong.github.io/year-archive/) to read my blogpost.
