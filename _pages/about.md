Name's Chee Loong (or Cody) - spent half a decade mastering the art of data manipulation and virtual dashboard architecture, yet my true superpower isn't my technical skills but my magnetic personality that defies standard human metrics. 

I have previously worked in Crave Asia (Digital), EY (Project Management), AIA (Consumer Marketing), GRAB (Risk), and now Coda (Risk). While many shift roles chasing bigger paychecks, my transitions have been fueled by something less tangible but far more valuable: the pursuit of insurmountable challenges and exponential personal growth (be it domain knowledge, new techstack, soft skill development, or bigger responsibilities) - just to be clear I still have to pay water bills, so please do not underpay me, hit me up if you've got a job opportunity!
