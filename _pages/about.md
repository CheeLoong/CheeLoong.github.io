I am an aspiring data scientist looking for job opportunities in the relevant field. I am open to work as an intern in exchange for relevant working experience in the field of data science (in hope that it might turn into a permanent role). When I tell you Passion > Money, I mean it.

Tale of a gutsy data scientist:
- I have graduated from Monash University Clayton with a bachelor degree majoring in Finance & Econometrics.
- I worked in a digital marketing firm for 15 months, left to pursue for a career in data science.
- I got a job in a consulting firm as a data scientist associate, worked for 3 months and received 'Gold Standard' for my efforts in projects and a job offer letter, I declined the job offer due to lack of exposure in the technical aspect of data science (Not bragging, just want you to know the 'real' me)
- My go-to domains would be finance sector (due to my background), or telco sector (preferably on customer analytics), I am open to other opportunities as well, it beats being unemployed at least.

- I have done miniature machine learning projects such as predicting survivability of passengers on Titanic, predicting credit card frauds, and some other projects (I assure you that bigger projects are coming, on this very blogsite of mine) 
- I have also ran some PostgreSQL queries via PgAdminIII, MySQL queries via JupyterNotebook / Teradata Viewpoint Interface.
- I have built a live demo visualization dashboard using SAP Lumira Discovery.
- I have done data analysis on Biomedical data in Rstudio, when I was partaking MOOC 'Data Science' Specialization offered by John Hopkins University in 2016.

I need you to understand that, my top priority isn't the prestigious name of your company, a high salary package, flexible hours, or even awesome company benefits. My top priority is to gain real-world analytics experience / knowledge that would grow me as a data scientist.

tl;dr: I am an awesome individual with superb qualities, hire me, call 016-2179937.
