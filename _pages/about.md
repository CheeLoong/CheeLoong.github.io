Hi stranger, my name is Chee Loong, some people call me Cody, I am a self taught data scientist, data analyst, data ninja, or whatever you want to call it to make me feel better about myself.

I have started my data science journey in 2017 and started working in the analytics field in 2018, I have worked in EY as a data consultant, and am currently in AIA as a data scientist.
