# Who's Chee Loong?

He is a **Finance & Econometrics** graduate of **Monash University Clayton University**. He's also a self-proclaimed driven, passionate data scientist, 26 years of age, going through quarter-life crisis, falls under the 3.3% of unemployed Malaysian in 2019. As tough as it sounds, it's really not that bad (you gotta look at the bright side of everything right?)

Anyway, He worked in a digital marketing firm known as **Crave Asia Sdn. Bhd**. for 15 months as a **digital analyst**, his main responsibilities were media budget optimization for social media adverts, identifying success metrics & tracking metrics for the digital campaign, and also writing post digital campaign reports. Then, He was hired by **Ernst & Young Services Sdn. Bhd.** as a **Data Scientist Associate**, but really he worked as a **Data Consultant**.

***I am glad you asked what does a data consultant do!***

The less cool description is that there was a lot of meet ups with the key executives, a lot of Microsoft Powerpoint Presentation & Excel.

The slightly cooler version was that he was responsible for identifying the key performance indicators for BI, help compile the data warehouse architecture for data migration purpose, co-write analytics proposal and come up with use-cases.

***Seriously, you gotta speak about yourself in third person?***

Okay I thought that was kinda cool, my bad.

***So why did you quit? (Assuming you aren't a disloyal employee)***

How can I begin to explain this without sounding like I am just a guy who is pushing responsibilities or giving excuses? To be honest, I can't, but I will try.

Looking back, I would admit that it was impulsive of me to quit the job after a period of 3 months (despite getting top performance reviews & job offer), everyone told me not to, I pretty much got what everyone wanted from a job except that I didn't get the only thing that I cared about, which is to the exposure in the technical field of data analytics.

The thing is I don't hate my job, I actually adore it, it's just that I love it less than the other job, and I sat down and thought about which to focus on, I work extra time as a **data consultant** using my personal time, because I was striving to be a better **data consultant**, but the same question kept popping in my head, is that truly what I want to do?

Then I saw this..

Okay, so there were 2 reasonable considerations at that time, either I continue to work as a **data consultant** and wait for job opportunities to work as a **data scientist**, or leave without any job opportunities in hand.

I opted for the second option, the reason is simple, I do not have a technical background, and so it would be hard to get a technical job without having technical background, or technical working experience, rather than waiting for a very slim possibility of gaining technical working experience with my current job, I opted to self-learn the technical aspect of data analytics, and consequently, leaving my full time job.  

It is a path that sounded logical to me, probably not to everyone else, I did not really question the probability of me landing on a technical job when I hand in the resignation letter, all I was thinking is that, to me that was the right thing to do, and even if odds were not in my favour, it's important enough.

***So what were you doing when you were unemployed?***

A lot of MOOCs, I learned a lot of traditional algorithm and methodologies, I went to a lot of DS interviews which I wasn't shortlisted (I guess traditional algorithm isn't good enough), but it did opened my eyes on the standard and qualities that the top companies are looking for from their candidates. I don't feel upset getting rejected, but rather I wanted to know how can I be better, so I got some advices from some DS on Linkedin, I watched a lot of 'how to get a job as DS' on Youtube, piecing up the advices from all sources, started deep learning, started blog, put learnings and my personal work on blog as portfolio.

Fingers crossed that 2019 will be a prosperous year!
