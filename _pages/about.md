He is a **Finance & Econometrics** graduate of **Monash University Clayton University**. He's also a self-proclaimed driven, passionate data scientist, 26 years of age, going through quarter-life crisis, falls under the 3.3% of unemployed Malaysian in 2019. As tough as it sounds, it's really not that bad (you gotta look at the bright side of everything right?)

Anyway, He worked in a digital marketing firm known as **Crave Asia Sdn. Bhd**. for 15 months as a **digital analyst**, his main responsibilities were media budget optimization for social media adverts, identifying success metrics & tracking metrics for the digital campaign, and also writing post digital campaign reports. Then, He worked as a **data scientist associate** in **Ernst & Young Services Sdn. Bhd.** for 3 months, He was responsible for identifying the key performance indicators for BI, help compile the data warehouse architecture for data migration purpose, co-write analytics proposal and come up with use-cases.

(Seriously, you gotta speak about yourself in third person?)

Okay I thought that was kinda cool, my bad.

**So why did you quit?**

I hope you will give me the benefit of the doubt when I tell you I left my work simply because I was not able to learn what I wanted to learn, do what I wanted to do, it sounded selfish yes? No, because I delivered my work professionally and I receive 'Gold Standard' for my work performances, heck I even get a job offer, I turned it down without any back up plan (Maybe that was a bit dumb, maybe...).

You see, what I am looking for, is to be able to get my hands dirty, to transform a bunch of numbers into insights that will drive business decisions. That's what I am passionate about, that's what I want to learn, that's what I want to do everyday (and yes including weekends), you could call me lifeless for that, but to me, that's better than working for a job and only concerning about the paycheck that you get every month.

I think my biggest fear in life is dying without having done all the things that I wanted to do in life, I think it's very millenial of me to say this, but I want to have a positive impact on the world someday, and I believe the way to go is to do what you are passionate about, to never give up, and to never stop learning, and if you think about the vastness of the universe and how miniature our lives are in comparison to everything else, we really have a responsibility to live it so that it felt significant to us.
