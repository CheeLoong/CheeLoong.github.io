I am a **Finance & Econometrics** graduate of **Monash University Clayton University**. My hobby is..kind of random because it changes as I grew older (true story). I used to play digital card game at a professional level, then I started working out at the gym and lost like 12kg, and now its Netflix and chill (fats +1) and writing this blog so that I can tell people I can code (effort +1).  

In terms of my career journey, I worked in a digital marketing firm known as **Crave Asia Sdn. Bhd**. for 15 months as a **digital analyst**, my main responsibilities were media budget optimization for social media adverts, identifying success metrics & tracking metrics for the digital campaign, and also writing post digital campaign reports. Then, I worked as a **data scientist associate** in **Ernst & Young Services Sdn. Bhd.** for 3 months, I mainly help identifying the key performance indicators for BI, help compile the data warehouse architecture for data migration purpose, co-write analytics proposal and come up with use-cases.

I am currently unemployed and are looking for opportunities in the data analytics field (preferably in the data science department). Contact me if you are looking for a data scientist :)
