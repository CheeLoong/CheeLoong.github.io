My name is Chee Loong, am a **Finance & Econometrics** graduate of **Monash University Clayton University**, also a self-proclaimed driven, passionate data scientist, 26 years of age, going through quarter-life crisis, falls under the 3.3% of unemployed Malaysian in 2019.

Anyway, I worked in a digital marketing firm known as **Crave Asia Sdn. Bhd**. for 15 months as a **digital analyst** in the year 2016 - 2017. Then, upon realizing where my passion lies, I left and self-taught DS skills. Luckily for me, in 2018, I was hired by **Ernst & Young Services Sdn. Bhd.** as a **Data Scientist Associate**, but really I worked as a **Data Consultant** for 3 months and received a full-time job offer letter towards end of my probation period, I turned it down and handed in a resignation letter instead.
